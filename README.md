# Decoder Ring
## An application that can encode or decode a mesage using a variety of ciphers.

The Caesar Shift is a type of substitution cipher originally used by Julius Caesar to protect messages of military significance. It relies on taking the alphabet and "shifting" letters to the right or left, based on the typical alphabetic order.

### Example:

```Message: hello world```
```Shift Number: 3```
```Output: khoor zruog```

The Polybius Square is a cipher that is achieved by arranging a typical alphabet into a grid. Each letter is represented through a coordinate. Typically, it is possible to arrange the letters however you like and read off the coordinates in whatever direction you like.

### Example:

```Message: hello world```
```Output: 3251131343 2543241341```

The Substitution Cipher requires a standard alphabet and a substitution alphabet. Letters from the standard alphabet will be transposed to the substitution alphabet. This cipher requires that the recipient have the substitution alphabet; otherwise, it will be difficult for them to decode the message.

### Example:

```Message: hello world```
```Alphabet Key: xoyqmcgrukswaflnthdjpzibev```
```Output: rmwwl```
